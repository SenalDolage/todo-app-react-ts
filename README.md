# Todo Notes App React TS

A to-do notes list application built with React and TypeScript, featuring categories, markdown support, filtering, and more.

This project was created to revisit and reinforce core React and TypeScript concepts, while building something practical and useful.

I did this project to revise concepts such as:
- TypeScript interfaces and generics in React
- Functional components and hooks
- State management patterns
- Component composition and props typing
- Real-world UI/UX with React Bootstrap

## Features

- View, Add, edit, and delete tasks
- Markdown support for task descriptions
- Filter tasks (e.g., by tags)
- Responsive design using [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
- Modern React patterns (`useState` and custom hooks)
- Strongly typed components and state management with TypeScript
